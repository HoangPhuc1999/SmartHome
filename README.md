# ABOUT THIS PROJECT


Hello everyone, my name is Phuc Hoang Nguyen, student of Computer Engineering Technology from Humber College.<br>
If you want to build a project to control 28BYJ-48 Stepper Motor with ULN2003APG driver, this is a step by step blog to help you achieve that.

It is better to buy the whole arduino kit on amazon, as the kit will have all the component needed for the project, this include:<br>

+) uln2003APG<br>
+) 28BYJ-48 stepper Motor<br>
+) Arduino <br>
+) Beard board<br>
+) Wire<br>
+) Jumper Wire<br>

 At the same time, you should also order/made your PCB, the Gerber file to build the PCB is down below:
- Gerber export file [here](https://github.com/HoangPhuc1999/SmartHome/tree/master/Documentation/GERBER)<br>
And if you are the one who wants a case for your project, here is a simple case design:

Link to buy the [arduino kit](https://www.amazon.ca/Elegoo-Project-Starter-Tutorial-Arduino/dp/B01D8KOZF4/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=2DVN7H6ZQLWPG&keywords=arduino+kit&qid=1574921884&sprefix=arduino+k%2Caps%2C145&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExTUVOUEhHNEhDTUZQJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwOTc2NjcxQVRIUzQyVFBNQUg3JmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA3NjA2NDQxMFhPMlJCUkVSSlRJJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==)

So instead of waiting months for your components to arrive if you purchase through China company, the shipping time will aproximately 2 bussiness days through amazon. 

# SOFTWARE
I use [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) to write code and upload code to the arduino  <br>
[Fritzing] (https://fritzing.org/home/) to design the PCB.

# NECESSARY TOOLS AND MACHINES

Soldering iron gun<br>

# Wiring - Connecting the Driver with the Arduino and the motor 

The wiring diagram/schematic below shows you how to connect the ULN2003 driver board to the 28BYJ-48 stepper motor and the Arduino.

I use jumper wire with different color to make the connect as the picture above.

# ULN2003 and 28BYJ-48 to Arduino Connections

| ULN2003APG    | Connection     |
| ------------- | -------------  |
| IN1           | Pin 11 Arduino |
| IN2           | Pin  9 Arduino |
| IN3           | Pin 10 Arduino |
| IN4           | Pin  8 Arduino |
| -             | Ground Arduino |
| +             | 5V Arudino     |

# PCB Design
 
 I use fritzing software to design my PCB, here is my final design. While waiting for the arduino kit to be delivered, start working on the PCB. You should have the PCB made as soon as you start the project, so when the parts arrive, you can start soldering and assembling the PCB with the motor and arduino.<br>

 # Solder Precaution: 
-For those who are beginners in solder, it is recommended to have more than one PCB made for this project. Set the solder Pen no hotter than 350F <br>
-Never touch the element or tip of the soldering iron. They are very hot (about 400Â°C) and will burn.<br>
-Hold wires to be heated with tweezers or clamps.<br>
-Keep the cleaning sponge wet during use.<br>
-Always return the soldering iron to its stand when not in use. Never put it down on your workbench.<br>
Turn unit off or unplug it when not in use.<br>

 # Basic Arduino example code to control a 28BYJ-48 stepper motor
 <img src ="Documentation/Project picture/code.PNG">
 
 This example code will rotates the motor continuosly until you unplug the arduino.
 
 # Unit test
 
 - STEP 1: CHECK THE ARDUINO<br>
 Before using the PCB, make sure you test the motor and arduino seperately. Connect the arduino to the laptop and run example code first to make sure the arduino is fine.

 If the led in the arduino blinks, that arduino should be good.<br>
- STEP 2: CHECK THE MOTOR<br>
 After that, you should check the motor by connect it directly to the arduino using wires. Run the example code for the stepper moter, if the motor rotates continously, it should be good. <br>
 - STEP 3: CHECK THE PCB
  Lastly, after soldering the PCB, make sure that every contact is properly seal, all the via connection is being connect.
